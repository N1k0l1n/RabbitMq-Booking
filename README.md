# C# RabbitMQ Booking App
This is a C# application that utilizes RabbitMQ messaging system to handle bookings for a service.

# Features
Sends booking requests to a RabbitMQ exchange
Listens for booking confirmation messages from RabbitMQ queue
Handles booking failures and retries
Provides an easy-to-use API for integrating booking functionality into other applications
Supports concurrent bookings for improved performance
Prerequisites
.NET Core SDK (version X.X or higher)
RabbitMQ server installed and running
# Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/csharp-rabbitmq-booking-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd csharp-rabbitmq-booking-app
Build the solution:

Copy code
dotnet build
Configuration
Open the appsettings.json file and update the following settings with your RabbitMQ configuration:

json
Copy code
{
  "RabbitMQ": {
    "Host": "localhost",
    "Port": 5672,
    "Username": "guest",
    "Password": "guest",
    "ExchangeName": "booking-exchange",
    "QueueName": "booking-queue",
    "RoutingKey": "booking"
  }
}
# Usage
Start the RabbitMQ server if it's not running.

# Run the application:

arduino
Copy code
dotnet run
This will start the booking application and it will begin listening for booking requests.

Integrate the booking functionality into your own application by sending a POST request to http://localhost:5000/api/booking with a JSON payload containing the booking details.

Example Request:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "date": "2023-05-17",
    "time": "15:00",
    "service": "Massage"
}' http://localhost:5000/api/booking
The booking application will process the request and send a booking confirmation message to the RabbitMQ queue. You can implement a listener in your own application to receive and handle the confirmation message.
